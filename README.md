### Running the app

Installing
$ yarn

$ yarn serve

Then, visit http://localhost:5000

The `serve` script makes use of [`gi-webapp-build-tools`](https://github.com/globality-corp/gi-webapp-build-tools) Globality package which is the generic package we use to handle build and run processes for all of our Front-end applications. Please refer to the documentation for that repo in order to learn more about it.
